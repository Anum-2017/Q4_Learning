# 🤖 What is Generative AI? :
**Generative AI** refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text 📝, images 🖼️, audio 🎶, or even code 💻. It is based on learning patterns from existing data and using that knowledge to generate new, original outputs that resemble the input data. Unlike traditional AI models, which are designed to recognize patterns or make predictions based on existing data, generative AI can produce entirely new and unique results.

# Difference Between AI vs Generative AI 🤖

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: AI is a broad field that involves creating systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, decision-making, and pattern recognition. AI can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from simple data analysis to complex reasoning.

**Generative AI:** Generative AI is a subset of AI that focuses specifically on creating new content. It learns from existing data and generates new instances (like text, images, etc.) that resemble the original data. In contrast to traditional AI, which focuses on classification or prediction tasks, generative AI focuses on creating something novel.

# How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI works by learning from large datasets using machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning models like neural networks. The most common approach used in generative AI is based on two types of networks:

**1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: These consist of two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—that work in opposition. The generator creates new data, and the discriminator evaluates whether the generated data is real (from the training dataset) or fake. Over time, the generator improves its ability to create realistic data.

**2) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: These are another type of generative model that learns to encode data into a lower-dimensional space and then decode it back into the original format. They are often used for generating images or other types of data.

Generative models are trained on a large corpus of data (text, images, etc.), and during training, they learn the underlying patterns. Once trained, these models can generate new, previously unseen content based on the patterns they've learned.
