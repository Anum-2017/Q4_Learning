# 📘 Introduction to FastAPI

**FastAPI** is a modern Python web framework for building APIs. It is fast, easy to use, and built on top of Starlette and Pydantic for web handling and data validation. FastAPI uses Python's type hints for automatic validation, serialization, and documentation generation, making it an ideal choice for creating efficient, high-performance RESTful APIs.

# ❓ What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a web framework that helps developers build APIs quickly. It leverages Python's type annotations to automatically handle data validation and generate documentation. Based on the ASGI specification, FastAPI is highly efficient, especially for asynchronous applications, and it auto-generates interactive API docs with tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc.
